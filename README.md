# Bark
Bark is a full stack web app built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, handlebars.js and MongoDB. This app allows users to either select if they are a pet sitter or pet owner. Owners and sitters both have different dashboards. Owners can search for available sitters and select filters such as price, size of dog, and difficulty level of dog the sitter is comfortable with. 
Includes secure registration and password hashing.
